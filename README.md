# DDF-Knight

This is an archive of video game "DDF Knight", made during a Peking University AI / ML camp.

DDF Knight is a turn-based strategy game in which you control your character moving towards enemies to destroy them while avoiding being flanked by them. A Tensorflow model was trained to play this game for the second half of the camp. Unfortunately, this part of the code is currently in another private repository.
