# DDF-Knight

This is an archive of video game "DDF Knight", made during the PKU AI / ML camp in Winter 2020. 
There is also a trained TensorFlow model to play the game (kind of awfully, but still better than Jiang Xu).

Note: this is an archive of the original project. Some of the functions may not work properly.
